Project Name: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Amazon Electronic Parts Reviews

Project Overview:
	This project involves a concise EDA of Amazon electronic parts reviews. The main objectives are to extract insights, prepare the data for sentiment analysis, and create an interactive dashboard. Note that we will work with a sample of the dataset (500,000 rows, 12 columns) due to its large size about (6.7M rows, 12 columns).

Project Phases:

1. Data Collection: Gather Amazon electronic parts reviews dataset with 500,000 rows.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, duplicates, outliers, and convert timestamps.

3. EDA: Conduct statistical analysis, explore rating distributions, and identify common themes.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Label reviews as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and train a sentiment analysis model.

5. Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize findings.

6. Reporting: Document the process and provide recommendations for future steps.

Expected Outcomes: 
	Clean dataset, insights, an interactive dashboard, and Prepare data for sentiment analysis model.


Conclusion: 
	This project delivers valuable insights from Amazon electronic parts reviews through EDA, making it a useful resource for decision-making and product improvement. The interactive dashboard enhances data usability.
